# Working With Missing And Duplicate Data
## Learn how to work with missing and duplicate data in pandas.
### In this mission, we'll explore each of these options in detail and learn when to use them. We'll work with the 2015, 2016, and 2017 World Happiness Reports - more specifically, we'll combine them and clean missing values as we start to define a more complete data cleaning workflow.
