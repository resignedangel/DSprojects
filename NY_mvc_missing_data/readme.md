## New York City Motor Vehicle Collisions 2018

In this project we'll learn how to handle missing data without having to drop rows and columns using data on motor vehicle collisions released by New York City and published on the [NYC OpenData website](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95). There is data on over 1.5 million collisions dating back to 2012, with additional data continuously added.
We'll work with an extract of the full data: Crashes from the year 2018. We made several modifications to the data for teaching purposes, including randomly sampling the data to reduce its size.

The whole workflow can also be accessed as [the DeepNote here.](https://beta.deepnote.com/publish/265a6eec-2b71-4f75-88c3-8e385330f124-e50701d8-7e24-48ce-b35d-620d37aba47b)
